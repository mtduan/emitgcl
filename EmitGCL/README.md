# EmitGCL Project

## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the EmitGCL project. This repository contains all the source code for EmitGCL, a graph contrastive learning model designed to detect early metastatic cell groups by integrating knowledge from primary and metastatic sites. EmitGCL excels in identifying subtle cellular differences, with high sensitivity and low false positive rates, especially in rare and early-stage metastatic cells, offering crucial insights for cancer prognosis and treatment.

## Source Code

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source code located in this repository is organized into various files, each serving a specific purpose in the overall functioning of the EmitGCL project.Here is an overview of the main files and their content:
